# PythonCF
Python Creative Framework (Similar to Processing)

This is the repositary for a processing like framework for Python. Though python is not as fast as Java, the simplicity of writing a piece of code in python is way easier and user friendly. I know there is already a processing.py that is based on python, but the underlying python is Jython a java based interpretor and cannot be used along with CPython. So the aim of the project is to have a pure python based framework, by pure I mean, the ability to use other python libraries to do creative coding. 

There are many ways the framework can be prepared

1. Pure pythonic way. (Benefits of the code being extremely readable)
2. Building the core extensions in C or C++ and making a python wrapper around it. (This will help do all the core processes faster then the usual route)

The first technique no matter how much we want to make it in pure python, is simply not possible due to lack of any pure pythonic windowing system. 

So the project will have milestones, starting from the most basic of having a windowing system to finall implementaion of every processing api.

Feel free to do any amendements to the current apporoach. And yes I do need support, I am not a one man army.
